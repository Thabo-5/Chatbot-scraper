          "context": "The Future of Learning and Development\r\nDriving core strategic value\r\n4IR: Not for the feint-hearted\r\nLearning and Development functions need to evolve quickly as the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) unfolds at a rapid pace. Half of the jobs today will not be around in 5 years and half of tomorrow’s jobs do not exist yet. Machines are becoming more capable and replacing humans at increasing speeds leaving organisations playing catch up to acquire, upskill and reskill an ever changing employee base that works alongside these machines.\r\nFactors shaping the future of learning technology:\r\nDIGITAL LEARNING\r\nMOBILE LEARNING\r\nPEER-TO-PEER LEARNING\r\nPROJECT-BASED LEARNING\r\nEXPERIENTIAL LEARNING\r\nPERSONALIZED LEARNING\r\nWe are fast moving to a world of complex digital skills, cross-functional teams, remote working and agile, project-based delivery structures ﬁlled with young, digital natives who have different ambitions than the traditional workforce.\r\nIn South Africa there is the additional complexity of Employment Equity, anemic economic growth and the BBBEE Scorecard to worry about. Added to this are a set of outdated accredited courses that teach skills that are redundant in our Digital Age. Yet companies still spend money on these to score the points they need for their BBBEE Scorecard.\r\nHow do Learning and Development Executives earn their keep in this fast-moving environment? \r\nThe Challenge\r\nEXPLORE was given the task to build a Data Science Academy for a large Telecommunications organisation that wanted to drive scarce Digital Skills into its business as well as the broader South African economy. The project included the requirement to maximise BBBEE Skills Development points.\r\nMaximising BBBEE Skills Development points\r\nDriving scarce Digital Skills into its business \r\nDriving these scarce skills into the broader South African economy\r\nDelivering a clear RoI on its investment\r\nThe Solution\r\nEXPLORE built a ﬁrst of its kind Data Science Programme, recruited 100 smart youngsters and delivered a practical year-long programme. The design principles of  this  intervention  were  to  teach  critical  digital  skills  that  would  quickly  be absorbed by an economy that urgently needs them.\r\nDetails of the programme are included below:\r\nBUILD A WORLD-CLASS DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMME\r\nEXPLORE built a bespoke Data Science Programme for the client. The programme was built by top local academics (ex Head of Actuarial Science UCT) and practitioners (ex Chief Actuary Nedbank) that delivered the latest cutting edge Data Science tools, techniques and platforms to students. \r\nRECRUIT THE BEST \r\nEXPLORE recruited 100 learners from around the country. These students were a diverse  mix  of  students  from  different  backgrounds,  qualiﬁcations,  ages  and socio-economic upbringings. All had to pass through EXPLORE’s tough 3-step recruitment process. Over 10,000 students applied. Only 100 were granted scholarships. The group were 98% representative of South Africa’s population.\r\nTEACH REAL-WORLD PROBLEM SOLVING\r\nEXPLORE taught students practical problem solving skills. The curriculum was a series of Sprints where students were put into teams to solve problems with deadlines. We found that the best way to teach complex topics is through the practical application of them.\r\nWORKING WITH THE CLIENT ON THEIR PROJECTS\r\nThe second half of the academic calendar involved teams being set up to solve the client’s actual problems. Real problems were set up with actual client data and sponsors in place to manage and direct the problem solving process.\r\nStudent Results\r\nThe results of the year long programme were compelling. Retention, graduation, placement and performance rates were high. Client satisfaction was also high across project delivery, student etiquette and EXPLORE delivery.\r\n95% Graduated\r\nR360,000 Average Starting Salary\r\n93% Placed\r\n45 Days on average to get placed\r\n9/10 Employer NPS of 9/10\r\n27% In the Financial Services Industry\r\nBeneﬁts\r\nThe beneﬁts for the client were signiﬁcant. The project delivered well across 4 key dimensions having a signiﬁcant return on the investment.\r\nFor 18M Investment\r\n1 ~10 Maximum BBBEE Points Points\r\n2 ~R40M - R50M Consulting Value Solutions\r\n3 30 Top Talent Hired Talent\r\n4 R4M Rebates Refund\r\nThe business ended the year as a BBBEE Level 1 Provider, putting out offers to hire 30 of the Data Scientists (with no recruitment fee payable) and roughly R50M in consulting revenue back to the business from the students’ projects!\r\nOur Recommendation\r\nToo often L&D spend is an expense item on the Income Statement where money is spent exactly how it was spent 10 years ago. Instead we think L&D Executives should be thinking about L&D spend differently:\r\nAs a strategic investment in growing the talent pool of the business\r\nAs a means to build out the digital talent it needs to survive and thrive in the Digital Age\r\nAs an investment that has a measurable RoI\r\nAs an initiative that is core to the business \r\nAs a recruitment strategy to get the best young (and often hidden) talent into the business\r\nAs a brand building exercise \r\nABOUT EXPLORE\r\nEXPLORE is a next generation learning institution on a mission to deliver Digital Skills at scale. It has worked with many Blue Chips, both locally and globally, helping them transform to become more Data-Driven and Insights-led.\r\nOur services include:\r\nBUILDING A PIPELINE OF DATA TALENT FOR YOUR ORGANIZATION \r\nEXPLORE teaches a range of courses that include Data Science, Data Analytics, Data Engineering and Data Translation where you can sponsor the next generation of digital talent.\r\nUPSKILLING YOUR CURRENT WORKFORCE\r\nWe have a range of short and long courses for your workforce so that they are ready to reset their skill-sets and turbo-charge their careers into the Digital Age.\r\nPLACING SCARCE DIGITAL SKILLS INTO YOUR BUSINESS\r\nWe have access to a long list of talented skills that we can match to your company’s needs to best set you up for success.\r\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\r\nWe have some of the best Scientists around who have decades of experience solving problems, both locally and globally.

          "context": "Becoming an Insights-Led Organisation\r\nRestarting the journey\r\nThe Sexiest Career in the World\r\nEver since The Harvard Business Review published that ‘Data Science is the Sexiest Career of the 21st Century’, executives around the world have had a tough time of it. Boards, CEOs and Analytics Heads have felt pressure to build ‘Data-Driven’ and ‘Insights-Led’ organisations.\r\nAlthough organisations have been ‘doing advanced analytics’ for decades many have been struggling to earn a real, tangible return on their data efforts proportional to the hype. Boards, CEOs and Investors are becoming impatient as the promise of the latest advances do not seem to be landing in the organisation.\r\nOur experience is that organisations are still battling to capture the signiﬁcant beneﬁts that Data Science has to offer. We have found that there is not yet a common language or a standard set of methodologies, processes and approaches to navigate this fast-moving ﬁeld.\r\nToday an organisation’s reﬂex is to hire a team of Data Scientists and hope that the magic will ﬂow. This, however, is not how the story unfolds. What happens is usually somewhat different: a company hires an expensive team of Data Scientists who build complex models that no-one really understands and that never make it into production. Circumspection sets in and soon the C-Suite views the Data Science effort as yet another fad next to a long list of failed initiatives.\r\nThis paper serves to share how we think an Organisation can (re)start its journey to being an Insights-Led organisation.  \r\nBetter, faster, cheaper\r\nWe look at an organization as a combination of decisions that are being made. Typically there are thousands of decisions being made every day. These decisions drive Enterprise Value. Some decisions are incredibly important and are signiﬁcant levers of value. For example, to whom a bank gives credit and at what interest rate is a critical decision. How well this decision is made can fundamentally impact the value of the enterprise.\r\nWE MAINTAIN THAT EVERY DECISION A BUSINESS MAKES IS DELIVERED\r\nBy a combination of humans and machines\r\nUsing a body of evidence and intuition\r\nTo optimise for a particular outcome\r\nEvery one of these decisions can improve significantly - a combination of better, faster and/or cheaper – by using the latest advances in Data Science.\r\nThe job of the organisation is to agree on the big decisions and mobilise Data teams around making those decisions better, faster and/or cheaper.\r\nTo start the Data Science journey the Executive team must work together to:\r\n1. Articulate the Opportunity Space. The Executive team must generate a set of Use Cases across the business where they think signiﬁcant value could be unlocked.\r\n2. Evaluate the Opportunities. A consistent framework for evaluating each opportunity must be agreed and then each Use Case evaluated using the chosen framework. From here a prioritisation process can begin.\r\n3. Prioritise the Opportunities. Once there is a common language for discussing the Opportunities the team can start ﬁghting for what to do when. The process is often a battle. Executives disagree. Emotions run high. This process is not easy.\r\n4. Allocate resources accordingly. After the prioritised list has been agreed the team must allocate resources to deliver the opportunities. Often internal resources are insufﬁcient to get everything done. The Executive should consider using external suppliers when it is sensible to do so - often external solutions will be better positioned than your internal teams to deliver value. Be open to that.\r\n5. Deliver value. After the long journey of agreeing who does what when, the hard work starts. The business must execute on the plans it has set. We propose that agile, multi-disciplined Data teams contract with business with signed-off scorecards, business sponsors and check-points to ensure delivery stays on track.\r\nHaving spent time with many Executive Teams we propose the process as set out above. We include some of the tools and frameworks that we ﬁnd work well to structure and guide the process below. We give some real-world examples to give the process some colour.\r\n1. ARTICULATE THE OPPORTUNITY SPACE\r\nStep 1: Each Executive works with his/her teams to uncover the big decisions that drive value in their area. For a Marketing Executive this may be ‘Do I market on television or via Social Media?’ and ‘What is the best time to air my radio advertisements?’. For an Operations Executive it may be ‘Where do I build my next branch?’ and ‘How do I reduce fraudulent claims?’\r\nStep 2: Each Executive must then prioritise the Top 5-7 Decisions in each of their areas. Often it is obvious what the big ticket items are and the team aligns quickly on the big decisions that they need help on. Other times it may not be clear and teams disagree.\r\nStep 3: Once the Top 5-7 Decisions have been agreed it is necessary to articulate each as a Problem Statement. This task, which sounds simple, is difficult and critical to get right. The framing of the Problem Statement drives the problem-solving process and, if carelessly phrased, can lead teams down blind alleys.\r\nAn  example  of  a  good  Problem  Statement:  ‘Should  we  build  a  branch  in suburb X, and, if so, what size investment is optimal?’ An example of a poor \r\nProblem Statement: ‘Where should I build a bank branch?’\r\nStep 4: The entire Executive then meet as a group. Each bring their Problem Statements to the table. These Problem Statements are then put down onto a single page for the team to have a single view of the Opportunity Space available to them.\r\nNEXT PAGE IS AN EXAMPLE OF A TYPICAL BANK’S OPPORTUNITY SPACE\r\nThe next task is then to evaluate each opportunity in a consistent manner so that the business can prioritise what to do when.\r\n2. EVALUATE THE OPPORTUNITIES\r\nNow that the Executive has a set of opportunities to consider what follows is the difﬁcult task of deciding what opportunity to do when. All opportunities are not made equal. Some are more difﬁcult than others. Some are ten times more valuable than the rest. Some require skills that the organization do not have.\r\nThe Executive must align by scoring a number of criteria for each Opportunity that can be used to prioritise the list.\r\nBELOW IS AN EXAMPLE THE CRITERIA THAT WE HAVE USED ACROSS A NUMBER OF ORGANISATIONS\r\nProblem Statement: Clear articulation of Problem to Solve\r\nValue to Unlock: Clear Valuation of Opportunity (NPV)\r\nDifﬁculty: Ease of Implementation\r\nKPI(s): KPIs to Track\r\nResource Required: People / Training Tools Investment\r\nApproach: How will Problem be Approached? What methodologies used?\r\nTime To Complete: Estimate of time to complete?\r\nMilestones: Key Milestones Key Go / No go Checkpoints\r\n3. PRIORITISE THE OPPORTUNITIES\r\nOnce the opportunities have been set and evaluated it is the difﬁcult task of the team to agree the prioritised list. Part art, part science, this is often a colourful process where each team member will ﬁght for the Use Case(s) that they have put forward. \r\nTo weight the factors selected in the previous step and then generate a ‘scientific answer’ to what the priorities should be\r\nHave an afternoon workshop where the team goes through the Opportunities and then votes (eg. using Google Forms) for their Top 5 Use Cases\r\nTo agree a Decision Maker (eg. CEO) who has the ﬁnal say at the end of the process\r\n4. ALLOCATING RESOURCES ACCORDINGLY\r\nOnce the team has a Top 5 or Top 10 set of Use Cases it is then time for the business to allocate resources. From our experience there will always be 10X more Use Cases than resources and, unfortunately, many of the Use Cases will be left on the shelf while the Internal Data Science capability begin their journey to build business value.\r\nFrom our experience a Scrum Team of 3-5 dedicated resources to deliver each Opportunity works well, with this number scaling up or down depending on the nature and difﬁculty of the work. Principles that we have found to work are:\r\nSmall autonomous teams are ideal\r\nTeams should work in an agile way \r\nUser feeback is critical to direct teams towards business value\r\nThe teams should integrate into the business - an IT and business representative should be on the team to ensure that the work is practical, relevant and can be implemented\r\nA range of skills - covering Consulting, Data Science, Data Engineering, Data Visualisation, System Integration, Data Management and Software Development are usually required to deliver value \r\nGiven the Supply/Demand gap to deliver on the Opportunities it is often sensible to consider external Data Science teams to deliver some of the Use Cases. This makes sense when the following holds true:\r\nThe value that can be unlocked is so great it does not make sense to wait for Internal teams\r\nExternal teams have solved the problem before and can quickly implement the solution\r\nExternal teams have skills that the Internal Teams do not have (eg. Experts at Image Classiﬁcation and Anomaly Detection to check for Claims Fraud on PDF-ed Invoices)\r\nThere is no sensitive internal data involved so issues such as privacy, GDPR and POPI are not relevant\r\nBELOW IS AN EXAMPLE OF A PRIORITISED LIST OF USE CASES WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL TEAMS ASSIGNED\r\nImproving Contactability\r\nImprove Credit Scoring\r\nWho to Hire / Fire\r\nFraud Detection\r\nImproving Customer Service\r\nImproving Digital Marketing\r\n3. DELIVER VALUE\r\nOnce the Opportunities have been allocated teams the real fun starts. To keep teams honest we have found that a scorecard should be set at the outset of each Use Case to keep the team both mindful of the problem they’re trying to solve and accountable to the work they’re doing.\r\nTo weight the factors selected in the previous step and then generate a ‘scientific answer’ to what the priorities should be\r\nHave an afternoon workshop where the team goes through the Opportunities and then votes (eg. using Google Forms) for their Top 5 Use Cases\r\nTo agree a Decision Maker (eg. CEO) who has the ﬁnal say at the end of the process\r\nIn addition to this we have believe that a Business Sponsor should be allocated to each team with fortnightly check-ins and monthly SteerCos. The team should work in an agile manner using Sprints, Daily Scrums and back-logs to manage the outcomes.\r\nABOUT EXPLORE\r\nEXPLORE is a next generation learning institution on a mission to deliver Digital Skills at scale.

We are not a theoretical institution (although we cover  the  theory)  -  we  are  a  ‘practical,  hands-on, roll-up-your-sleeves and get stuff done’ kind of institution. As real-world Scientists who have delivered impact in the world of work we’re well positioned to deliver these skills. \r\nEXPLORE  launched  during  2013  and  since  then  has  taught 1,000’s of students and solved many problems for businesses across multiple Industries across the world. We’re reinventing education and invite you to join us to change things for the better.\r\nWhy Machine Learning?\r\nFour megatrends are fundamentally changing the shape of our \r\nworld: \r\n1. Vast amounts of data are being generated every minute. \r\n2. The  processing  speed  of  our  machines  is  increasing exponentially.\r\n3. We  now  have  cloud  providers  who  can  store  insane amounts of data for a few dollars. \r\n4. Powerful  open  source  algorithms  that  can  read,  write, translate and see are now available to everyone. \r\nAll of these things above mean that it’s becoming easier and quicker  to  produce  models  that  can  analyze  bigger/more complex data and deliver more accurate results – even on a very large scale. By building prediction models a business has a better  chance  of  identifying  proﬁtable  opportunities  –  or avoiding unknown risks.\r\nCurriculum Overview\r\nThe course will start by covering the basics of programming in python  -  building  functions  to  automate  analysis.  After  the foundations have been set, participants will master the model building process and the various machine learning algorithms to use as well as exploring techniques such as clustering and natural language processing. In the ﬁnal phase participants will dive  deeper  into  the  more  complex  machine  learning techniques - deep learning, where they will cover all the various neural networks.\r\nProgramming\r\nPython Fundamentals 3 weeks\r\nPython Data Structures 3 weeks\r\nMachine Learning \r\nClassiﬁcation Techniques 4 weeks\r\nRegression Techniques 4 weeks\r\nUnsupervised Learning 4 weeks\r\nDeep Learning 4 weeks \r\nModule 1\r\nPython Fundamentals\r\nProject: Build a ﬁnancial calculator\r\nWhat is covered in Module 1:\r\nPython Programming Basics\r\nBasic Concepts\r\nWhat is programming\r\nInstalling Jupyter environment\r\nPseudo code and debugging concepts\r\nInteractive vs scripting mode\r\nVariables, Expressions and Statements\r\nPrint statements\r\nWorking with primitive data types -

Building things that work and make a difference is hard - that’s what we teach. \r\nWe’re not a traditional learning institution that spends weeks teaching  matrix  multiplication  on  a  whiteboard  (although understanding  that  is  useful)  -  we’re  a  practical, solution-orientated  institution  that  teaches  our  students  to work  in  teams,  under  pressure,  with  deadlines  while understanding context, constraints and the audience. \r\nOur courses are typically broken into Sprints where we teach a core set of concepts within the framework of solving a problem in a team with a tight deadline.\r\nStudents cycle from Sprint to Sprint solving different problems in  different  teams  as  they  build  this  core  muscle  over  the course.\r\nContact Information\r\nFor any admissions related enquiries mail us on: \r\nadmission@explore-ai.net\r\nFor any general enquiries mail us on: \r\ngeneral@explore-ai.net \r\nVisit: www.explore-datascience.net \r\n ",

Units pursue initiatives under the CoE’s guidance and coordination.\r\nFully centralized\r\nA Corporate Function is set up and takes direct responsibility for identifying, prioritizing and delivering all Data initiatives.\r\nIt is important to note that IT does not own any of the models above. While IT often plays a critical role in providing and maintaining the infrastructure and tools required to execute the Analytics initiatives, it is critical to note that business runs and owns the functions. So which model is best? That depends mainly on:\r\n1. EXISTING ANALYTICS CAPABILITIES\r\nCompanies with existing deep analytics capabilities can rely on a generally decentralized approach but this is an exception to the rule from what we’ve seen.\r\n2. STRATEGIC AMBITION\r\nCompanies that are fully data-driven organisations, need to maintain talent and focus close to the most important business problems - which is most suited to a centralized approach. \r\nFor any organisation, the choice of structure is not ﬁxed for the long-term, but may change  many  times  as  the  analytics  maturity  and  ambition  of  the  company evolves. \r\nFrom our experience many companies ﬁnd that a Centre of Excellence has the \r\n1. A Centre of Excellence enables BU’s to share learnings and best practice. \r\n2. It allows the business to build a large  set of data lakes that usually allows insights that would otherwise not have been possible. \r\n3. The Centre of Excellence enables synergies and scale benefits and is often the best mechanism for an organisation to accelerate its Data Science journey.\r\nSetting up a Centre of Excellence\r\nThis is not a quick or easy task. It requires strong analytics leadership as well as an A-Team of Data Scientists, Engineers, Analysts and Analytics Translators. Setting up a central unit like this typically takes 12-18 months and, to make a success of it, requires bold leadership that steps on toes and upsets the status quo.\r\nBeyond the center of excellence (COE), employees at all levels need to be trained.\r\nSenior Leaders \r\nBusiness leaders of a transformation or a use-case implementation\r\nManagers\r\nBusiness users (ie, mid-level managers) of  the outputs of analytics models and insights\r\nAnalytics Specialists \r\nDesign and build analytics models Iterate/reﬁne models based on business and user\r\nAnalytics Translators\r\nCollaborate with the business to understand the need and can guide analytics design to meet \r\nOur Recommendations\r\nChoose the structure that makes the most sense for your current business taking into account your analytics maturity and strategic ambition. Re-evaluate this decision frequently to re-assess the role of Data Science in the organisation and what structure best delivers the outcomes you require.\r\nSetting up a Centre of Excellence has many benefits, but requires the coordination and commitment of the entire organisation, something which takes extensive time and effort. \r\nWhen no single structure makes sense for an organisation, consider a hybrid model e.g. managing outsourced and remote talent vs full-time data resources.\r\nABOUT EXPLORE\r\nEXPLORE is a next generation learning institution on a mission to deliver Digital Skills at scale.

          "context": "﻿Scoring at EXPLORE - an explanation\r\nDear EXPLORERs,\r\nA number of you have had questions about your marks for each sprint and what they mean. This \r\ncommunication is meant to address those questions (and hopefully answer one or two you didn’t \r\nknow you had).\r\n \r\nHow do I get marks and what do they mean?\r\nAt EXPLORE the Data Science qualification is aligned with SETA, meaning that when you have \r\nsuccessfully finished with the course, you will have an NQF 5 accredited qualification. Since the \r\ncourse is SETA accredited, you don’t \"pass\" or \"fail\". You are found either \"competent\" or \"not \r\nyet competent\" in a given area, or “unit standard”. The trains, tests and predicts are built to align \r\nwith these unit standards.\r\nIn each Sprint, there are a set number of belt points available. These points are divided among \r\nTrains, Tests and Predicts and align with the various unit standards. Your overall sprint score is \r\nan indication of the proportion of available belt points you have gained for that sprint (i.e. a score \r\nof 70% means that you have gained 70% of the points for that Sprint).\r\nAs you go through the course and complete the material, you accumulate points in unit \r\nstandards. You need to accumulate enough points to be deemed \"competent\". An overall \r\n\"competent\" mark equates to about 70% (or approximately 460) of the belt points available in \r\nthe fundamentals phase. However, this is the bare minimum and we expect the majority of our \r\nstudents will perform much better than this.\r\n \r\nSo if I don’t get 70% for the fundamentals phase, does that mean I fail the course? Will I \r\nbe kicked out if I do badly in any sprint?\r\nNot at all! Belt points are cumulative, so if you do not have enough belt points at the end of \r\nfundamentals, you will have plenty of opportunity to accumulate more through the machine \r\nlearning phase (the second six months) to make up the shortfall.\r\nTherefore, you cannot \"fail\" a sprint and you will not be kicked out of the course. In the unlikely \r\nevent that you do not accumulate the required points throughout the entire course, you will not \r\nget an accredited qualification, but will still get a certificate of completion stating the tools and \r\ntechniques that you have experience with.\r\n \r\nDoes that mean that any belt points above the required amount are meaningless?\r\nNo. Your accumulated belt points are also used to calculate your belt level, which is indicative of \r\nyour mastery of the content. The scales are as follows:\r\nBelt colour\tScore (total accumulated belt points)\r\nWhite:\t\t<15%\r\nYellow:\t\t>15%\r\nOrange:\t\t>30%\r\nGreen:\t\t>40%\r\nBlue:\t\t>50%\r\nBrown:\t\t>65%\r\nRed:\t\t>80%\r\nBlack:\t\t>90%\r\nYour belt level will also be displayed on your certificate, so it’s in your best interest to do as well \r\nas you can, especially if you want to wow future employers.\r\n \r\nSo then how do I track my progress?\r\nYour current belt level and belt score (accumulated total of belt points so far) can be found under \r\nyour profile in Athena. This is the best indicator of your progress. The EGAD diagram shows the \r\nproportion of the total available belt points that you have earned for each EXPLORE basic pillar \r\nof Data Science (Explain, Gather, Analyse, Deploy). This is purely for your own enlightenment, \r\nto give you an idea of where your own strengths lie, but otherwise has no bearing on your marks.\r\n\r\nGreat! Can you tell me how many points each thing is worth so I know what to focus on?\r\nWe’re reluctant to share exact point allocations and weightings for each piece of content. This is \r\nbecause we want to discourage “point chasing” and gaming of the system. Many an EXPLORER \r\nhas found themselves in a difficult place because they spent too much time maximizing belt \r\npoints and too little time understanding the material.\r\nHowever, a VERY rough breakdown is as follows: 33% of points go to Trains, 33% to tests and \r\n33% to the Predict. This will change slightly depending on the sprint and its requirements but \r\nholds more or less true throughout.\r\n\r\nHelp! My points went up/down/disappeared/blew up/took my dog and left in the night!\r\nAthena is a complex beast with lots of calculations going on in the background. Occasionally we \r\nmay also have to slightly change belt point allocations due to errors with tests or submission or \r\nother administrative gremlins. As such, your belt point totals may vary slightly from time to \r\ntime. If you notice a big change or feel that something is wrong, you are welcome to reach out to \r\nus at online@explore-ai.net and we will do what we can to help.\r\n \r\nThanks for the info, but you didn’t address (insert important thing here).\r\nWe’re sure we’ve forgotten something, so if you have any burning questions around this, feel \r\nfree to reach out to us at online@explore-ai.net and we will do our best to give you an accurate \r\nand honest answer.\r\n",

Put differently: ﬁnd a few pink unicorns, \r\nput them in a room, wave a wand and watch the magic unfold. Unfortunately, it is \r\nnot this simple.\r\n \r\nTo deliver value a team requires a combination of different skills to be effective. \r\nThese skills/roles are expanding quickly and will continue to grow as businesses \r\nbecome more mature in this space. \r\nANALYTICS TRANSLATOR\r\nAnalytics translators play a critical role in bridging the technical expertise of data \r\nengineers and data scientists with the operational expertise of marketing, supply \r\nchain, manufacturing, risk, and other frontline managers. In their role, translators \r\nhelp ensure that the deep insights generated through sophisticated analytics \r\ntranslate into impact at scale in an organization.\r\nAnalytics translators should combine a deep understanding of domain knowl-\r\nedge and of the company itself. Many translators will come from quantitative \r\nﬁelds and possess advanced critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. How-\r\never, translators do not need to get bogged down in the smaller details of model \r\nbuilding and deep analytics, but rather focus on project management and have a \r\nworking understanding of the models that are often used to solve particular busi-\r\nness problems, e.g. RNNs for sequential data. \r\nBUSINESS \r\nSKILLS\r\nBusiness  Delivery \r\nLeaders Managers\r\nData  Analytics \r\nArchitects Translator\r\nWorkﬂow \r\nIntegrators\r\nTECHNOLOGY  ANALYTICS \r\nSKILLS Data  SKILLS\r\nScientists\r\nData  Visualization \r\nEngineers Analytics\r\n1\r\n DATA SCIENTIST\r\nA  Data  Scientist  uses  scientiﬁc  methods,  algorithms  and  systems  to  extract \r\ninsights from structured and unstructured data. Data Scientists have a strong \r\nblend of mathematics, computer science and statistical skills and have strong \r\nproblem-solving capabilities. They also possess the softer communication skills \r\nthat help them translate complex model output into valuable business input. \r\nA Data Scientist typically has an advanced level of education (Master’s degree or \r\nPhD) as the role requires a specialised depth of knowledge. Most data scientists \r\ncome from quantitative ﬁelds, with the largest group coming from Mathematics \r\nand Statistics, followed by Computer Science and Engineering. \r\nHaving an advanced degree is a necessary but not a sufﬁcient condition for being \r\na Data Scientist. The key to being a successful Data Scientist is to continue learning \r\neven  after  formal  education.  This  includes  online  courses,  competitions  (e.g. \r\nKaggle) and certiﬁcations in relevant platforms (e.g. Amazon’s AWS Cloud).\r\nExample: \r\nA Data Scientist typically possesses the following:\r\nGood knowledge of Python and/or R\r\nA knack for statistical analysis and predictive modeling\r\nExperience with SQL and NoSQL databases\r\nA knack for statistical analysis and predictive modeling\r\n2\r\n Solid understanding of machine learning techniques\r\nKnowledge of data management and visualization\r\ntechniques\r\nMATH, STATS, \r\nALGORITHMS\r\nData  Data \r\nEngineer Analyst\r\nData \r\nScientist\r\nSOFTWARE  DATA \r\nENGINEERING COMMUNICATION\r\nDATA ENGINEER\r\nData Engineers are the data professionals who prepare the “big data” infrastruc-\r\nture to be analyzed by Data Scientists. They are engineers who design, build and \r\nintegrate data from various resources, and manage big data. Then, they write \r\ncomplex queries on that, make sure it is easily accessible, works smoothly, and \r\ntheir goal is optimising the performance of their company’s big data ecosystem.\r\n3\r\n Data Engineers typically focus on coding in a wide range of programming lan-\r\nguage from Java and Scala to Python, cleaning up data sets and developing data \r\npipelines, and dealing with requests from Data Scientists as their data needs \r\nevolve.\r\nData Engineers are the crucial link between the models developed by Data Scien-\r\ntists and their execution in a production environment. They usually possess a deep \r\nknowledge of data storage and warehousing solutions, and programming frame-\r\nworks  such  as  Hadoop  and  Spark  that  can  help  you  source  data  and  run \r\ndata-heavy implementations on a clustered data architecture.\r\nExample: \r\nAdvanced working SQL knowledge and experience\r\nworking with relational databases, query authoring (SQL)\r\nas well as working familiarity with a variety of databases\r\nExperience building and optimizing ‘big data’ data\r\npipelines, architectures and data sets\r\nExperience performing root cause analysis on internal and\r\nexternal data and processes to answer specific business\r\nquestions and identify opportunities for improvement\r\nStrong analytic skills related to working with\r\nunstructured datasets\r\n4\r\n Experience with relational SQL and NoSQL databases,\r\nincluding Postgres and Cassandra\r\nExperience with object-oriented/object function scripting\r\nlanguages: Python, Java, C++, Scala, etc\r\nSKILLS\r\nAdvanced  Advanced \r\nMath/Statistics Programming\r\nAnalysis\r\nDistributed \r\nML/AI\r\nProgramming Systems\r\nBig Data\r\nAdvanced  Data \r\nAnalytics Pipelines\r\nData Scientist Data Engineer\r\nDATA ANALYST\r\nData Analysts are experienced data professionals in their organization who can \r\nquery and process data, provide reports, summarize and visualize data. They have \r\na strong understanding of how to leverage existing tools and methods to solve a \r\nproblem, and help people from across the company understand speciﬁc queries \r\nwith ad-hoc reports and charts.\r\n5\r\n Data Analysts are typically skilled in data processing and manipulation, using \r\nmostly Excel to do so, although analytics dashboard platforms such as Tableau and \r\nQlik Sense provide new tools for data-rich reporting. \r\nExample: \r\nA Data Analyst typically possesses the following:\r\nPassion for data, automation and a curious learner of\r\nnew concepts and technologies\r\nExtensive SQL programming experience \r\nExperience of tools like Tableau, QlikView or PowerBI \r\nGood knowledge of Microsoft Excel\r\nGood verbal and written communication skills \r\nNEXT PAGE SHOWS A SET OF DATA ANALYIST REQUIRED SKILLS IN A DIAGRAM\r\n6\r\n Knowledge  Data \r\nAbout  Mining & \r\nAnalytical  Data \r\nTools Auditing\r\nData  SKILLS Testing \r\nVisualisation Skills\r\nBasic \r\nMachine \r\nStatistical \r\nLearning\r\nSkills\r\nAI ENGINEERS\r\nAI Engineers build, test, and deploy AI models, as well as maintain AI infrastruc-\r\nture.

          "context": "A Data Science Team\r\nChoosing the right asset allocation strategy\r\nSetting up the Dream Team\r\nA few years ago it was common practice for an organization to ‘just get a few Data Scientists on a team’ to solve the problem. Put differently: ﬁnd a few pink unicorns, put them in a room, wave a wand and watch the magic unfold. Unfortunately, it is not this simple.\r\nTo deliver value a team requires a combination of different skills to be effective. These skills/roles are expanding quickly and will continue to grow as businesses become more mature in this space. \r\nANALYTICS TRANSLATOR\r\nAnalytics translators play a critical role in bridging the technical expertise of data engineers and data scientists with the operational expertise of marketing, supply chain, manufacturing, risk, and other frontline managers. In their role, translators help ensure that the deep insights generated through sophisticated analytics translate into impact at scale in an organization.\r\nAnalytics translators should combine a deep understanding of domain knowl-\r\nedge and of the company itself. Many translators will come from quantitative \r\nﬁelds and possess advanced critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. However, translators do not need to get bogged down in the smaller details of model building and deep analytics, but rather focus on project management and have a working understanding of the models that are often used to solve particular business problems, e.g. RNNs for sequential data. \r\nDATA SCIENTIST\r\nA  Data  Scientist  uses  scientiﬁc  methods,  algorithms  and  systems  to  extract insights from structured and unstructured data. Data Scientists have a strong blend of mathematics, computer science and statistical skills and have strong problem-solving capabilities. They also possess the softer communication skills that help them translate complex model output into valuable business input. \r\nA Data Scientist typically has an advanced level of education (Master’s degree or PhD) as the role requires a specialised depth of knowledge. Most data scientists come from quantitative ﬁelds, with the largest group coming from Mathematics and Statistics, followed by Computer Science and Engineering. \r\nHaving an advanced degree is a necessary but not a sufﬁcient condition for being a Data Scientist. The key to being a successful Data Scientist is to continue learning even  after  formal  education.  This  includes  online  courses,  competitions  (e.g. Kaggle) and certiﬁcations in relevant platforms (e.g. Amazon’s AWS Cloud).\r\nExample: \r\nA Data Scientist typically possesses the following:\r\nGood knowledge of Python and/or R\r\nA knack for statistical analysis and predictive modeling\r\nExperience with SQL and NoSQL databases\r\nA knack for statistical analysis and predictive modeling\r\nSolid understanding of machine learning techniques\r\nKnowledge of data management and visualization techniques\r\nDATA ENGINEER\r\nData Engineers are the data professionals who prepare the “big data” infrastructure to be analyzed by Data Scientists. They are engineers who design, build and integrate data from various resources, and manage big data. Then, they write complex queries on that, make sure it is easily accessible, works smoothly, and their goal is optimising the performance of their company’s big data ecosystem.\r\nData Engineers typically focus on coding in a wide range of programming language from Java and Scala to Python, cleaning up data sets and developing data pipelines, and dealing with requests from Data Scientists as their data needs evolve.\r\nData Engineers are the crucial link between the models developed by Data Scientists and their execution in a production environment. They usually possess a deep knowledge of data storage and warehousing solutions, and programming frameworks  such  as  Hadoop  and  Spark  that  can  help  you  source  data  and  run data-heavy implementations on a clustered data architecture.\r\nExample: \r\nAdvanced working SQL knowledge and experience working with relational databases, query authoring (SQL) as well as working familiarity with a variety of databases\r\nExperience building and optimizing ‘big data’ data pipelines, architectures and data sets\r\nExperience performing root cause analysis on internal and external data and processes to answer specific business questions and identify opportunities for improvement\r\nStrong analytic skills related to working with unstructured datasets\r\nExperience with relational SQL and NoSQL databases, including Postgres and Cassandra\r\nExperience with object-oriented/object function scripting languages: Python, Java, C++, Scala, etc\r\nDATA ANALYST\r\nData Analysts are experienced data professionals in their organization who can query and process data, provide reports, summarize and visualize data. They have a strong understanding of how to leverage existing tools and methods to solve a problem, and help people from across the company understand speciﬁc queries with ad-hoc reports and charts.\r\nData Analysts are typically skilled in data processing and manipulation, using mostly Excel to do so, although analytics dashboard platforms such as Tableau and Qlik Sense provide new tools for data-rich reporting. \r\nExample: \r\nA Data Analyst typically possesses the following:\r\nPassion for data, automation and a curious learner of new concepts and technologies\r\nExtensive SQL programming experience \r\nExperience of tools like Tableau, QlikView or PowerBI \r\nGood knowledge of Microsoft Excel\r\nGood verbal and written communication skills \r\nNEXT PAGE SHOWS A SET OF DATA ANALYIST REQUIRED SKILLS IN A DIAGRAM\r\nAI ENGINEERS\r\nAI Engineers build, test, and deploy AI models, as well as maintain AI infrastructure.
