Top Student Reviews
EXPLORE really attracts some of the most talented, creative, and hardworking individuals I've met, but also the weirdest and socially awkward as well. I guess that's what I like about it, it's a place for anyone regardless of the differences we have to come together and pursue greatness by building next-level solutions.

EXPLORE hasn't only given me the courage to always set the bar higher but also acknowledge the human factor in all of us. They're not only equipping you with the best skills but also personally developing you into becoming better all the time.

The fact that I was allowed to use different methods to achieve a given task was freeing. I felt as if I was given a paint brush and an infinite array of colors to paint my solution without being put into a box.

Top Student Reviews
EXPLORE really attracts some of the most talented, creative, and hardworking individuals I've met, but also the weirdest and socially awkward as well. I guess that's what I like about it, it's a place for anyone regardless of the differences we have to come together and pursue greatness by building next-level solutions.
Jake Ruele
EXPLORE hasn't only given me the courage to always set the bar higher but also acknowledge the human factor in all of us. They're not only equipping you with the best skills but also personally developing you into becoming better all the time.
Thembisile Damon
The fact that I was allowed to use different methods to achieve a given task was freeing. I felt as if I was given a paint brush and an infinite array of colors to paint my solution without being put into a box.
