Top Student Reviews
The fact that I was allowed to use different methods to achieve a given task was freeing. I felt as if I was given a paint brush and an infinite array of colors to paint my solution without being put into a box.
Ntwanano Matjokane

I could always find happiness in being at EXPLORE and most of my highlights would be the networking or rather peers that I met.
