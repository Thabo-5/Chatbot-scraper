Top Student Reviews
My life is completely different to what it was before EXPLORE. I came from a business focused role. I had a desire to break into tech, more specifically Data Science and XPLORE’s program became the catalyst for that ambition to materialise. I went from knowing nothing about coding to now working in a role where I get to build and implement effective software solutions for some of the biggest organisations in SA.
Jake Ruele
A highlight was meeting some of the most amazing and intelligent people and doing some of the things I'd normally think are impossible!

Top Student Reviews
My life is completely different to what it was before EXPLORE. I came from a business focused role. I had a desire to break into tech, more specifically Data Science and XPLORE’s program became the catalyst for that ambition to materialise. I went from knowing nothing about coding to now working in a role where I get to build and implement effective software solutions for some of the biggest organisations in SA.
Jake Ruele
A highlight was meeting some of the most amazing and intelligent people and doing some of the things I'd normally think are impossible!
