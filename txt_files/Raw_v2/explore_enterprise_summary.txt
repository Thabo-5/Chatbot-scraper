BBBEE Spend that counts
EXPLORE is a SETA accredited institution so training spend earns BBBEE points. 
Maximising the outcomes from BBBEE spend has never been more critical. Organisations are changing, customer needs are shifting and the future is becoming less certain every day. In this climate, one sure thing is that data skills are increasing in relevance and demand.
Investing in practical skills which can be put to use creating value immediately is the most efficient way of leveraging your BBBEE spend. Our Employed and Unemployed learnerships deliver exactly these skills in a unique and impactful way.
Because of their dynamic approach to education and learning, combined with real world data science expertise, we identified EXPLORE as our ideal partner.
