Top Student Reviews
Overall, I had an awesome time studying with EXPLORE. The Academy doesn't just put it's emphasis on work, but the well-being of their students, which I find key to success in such a demanding industry. It's never been just about work! Yes it gets real and the deadline has to be met, but there's always that one, if not two, if not ten of EXPLORE’s staff cheering you on. Anyone and everyone can enroll in an online course, but not everyone can successfully carry it through to completion, like they do at EXPLORE.
Maggy Mhango
I found it exceedingly thrilling and filled with engrossing content and challenges that optimized the whole learning experience. The supportive atmosphere and culture, with highly eloquent instructors, created a positive learning space that evoked not only an unmatched yearn to take in what was delivered but to apply it to the best of our abilities while forging meaningful and fruitful relationships (networks). Nothing was as congenial as working with and solving real-life problems.
Atisang Molapo
EXPLOREs approach to skills development is cutting edge and progressive. My educational background is not in one of the STEM fields and yet I've found the skills I have learnt relevant for the job market and extremely valuable for myself as an individual seeking a competitive advantage in a data driven era. The combination of the hard and soft skills I've picked up has accelerated my career prospects in many ways.

Top Student Reviews
Overall, I had an awesome time studying with EXPLORE. The Academy doesn't just put it's emphasis on work, but the well-being of their students, which I find key to success in such a demanding industry. It's never been just about work! Yes it gets real and the deadline has to be met, but there's always that one, if not two, if not ten of EXPLORE’s staff cheering you on. Anyone and everyone can enroll in an online course, but not everyone can successfully carry it through to completion, like they do at EXPLORE.
Maggy Mhango
I found it exceedingly thrilling and filled with engrossing content and challenges that optimized the whole learning experience. The supportive atmosphere and culture, with highly eloquent instructors, created a positive learning space that evoked not only an unmatched yearn to take in what was delivered but to apply it to the best of our abilities while forging meaningful and fruitful relationships (networks). Nothing was as congenial as working with and solving real-life problems.
